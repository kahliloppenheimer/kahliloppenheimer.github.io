# [Kahlil.me][kahlil.me]

This is the source for kahlil.me, my new tech blog. The website is completely open source, so please feel free to fork this project and modify it if you like it.

## Technology
The site is built on the Jekyll platform, using the [Gaya theme][gaya-theme] as a base to work off of. It is hosted right here on github using github pages. Feel free to go check out the actual thing.
